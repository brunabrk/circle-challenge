## Non-Functional Testing

#### Performance

Since the application may have users with different internet connection speed it would be good to have a test that simulates a very slow internet connection, e.g. Edge.

## Improvements

## Questions

1. When the current streak should change? Currently, it's not changing when the user manually enters the meditation.
