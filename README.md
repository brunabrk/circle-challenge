# Circle Home Challenge

This challenge uses the Hey Linda project as a base: https://github.com/heylinda/heylinda-app and has the purpose of testing the app.

## Features Tested

- Meditate
- Track progress
- Time listened

## Test Cases

Please check: [Test Cases](test-cases/doc.md)

## Automation

The tool used was [Detox](https://wix.github.io/Detox/) to cover both platforms. The relevant test cases that warranted E2E tests were covered, the other ones should be covered in another test levels.

## Prerequisites

**Detox**

```
yarn global add detox-cli
```

For mac only:

```
brew tap wix/brew
brew install applesimutils
```

For more information about Detox setup please refer: [Detox getting started](https://wix.github.io/Detox/docs/introduction/getting-started)

**App**

```
yarn global add expo-cli
yarn install
```

For more information about App setup please refer: [HeyLinda app](https://github.com/heylinda/heylinda-app)

## Before Running the Tests

- Please have an emulator/a simulator installed and added to **_.detoxrc.js_** . Refer to [Detox](https://wix.github.io/Detox/docs/introduction/project-setup#step-3-device-configs)
- Create the iOS build using the following command:

```
yarn expo prebuild --platform ios
```

- Make sure the for React-native is running while testing the app:

```
yarn react-native start
```

## How to Run

**iOS**

```
yarn test:e2e:ios
```

**Android**

```
yarn test:e2e:android
```

## Artifacts

In case of failure a video and screenshots will be created in the artifacts folder.

## CI/CD

There are two examples of CI configurations in the project. The bitrise example is the most extensive and well tested due to monthly usage restrictions on github actions

**Bitrise**

You can see the CI and builds on the following url:
[Link](https://app.bitrise.io/app/15b6af4a-b75d-44f5-84d3-d44f946c045b)

Because of bitrise free plan limit of 30 minutes per build, it was impossible to run both ios and android builds with the free plan. The build was aborted as the screenshot shows:
![aborted build](./images/abort_build.png)

Given this constraint, I made the workflow run for iOS only [(iOS only workflow definition)](bitrise.yaml), but I validated that the android parts of the build pass as well, as seen here ![android build](./images/only_android_test.png)

Ultimately, the build should include both platforms, so I created this [Bitrise definition including iOS and Android](bitrise_complete.yml) with the full solution.

In case of failure in the tests, go to Artifacts tab, there will be video and screenshots.

**GitHub Actions**

Please see for [iOS](.github/workflows_example/e2e-ios.yml) and android [Android](.github/workflows_example/e2e-android.yaml)

## Improvements

- Detox automatically recognizes the emulator/simulator
- Start the react-native server before the tests and kill it after

## üìù **NOTE**

üö® There is an open issue in Detox that doesn't allow it to interact with any android emulator above 31! Please make sure to use an emulator with SDK < 32 (e.g: SDK 31). See issue [Detox Issue](https://github.com/wix/Detox/issues/3762) üö®
